#### Learning Objectives:

1. Introduction to Backend Web Development

   - Understanding using the resturant analogy

2. Introduction to HTTP/HTTPs

   - HTTP methods

     - GET
       The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
     - HEAD
       The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.
     - POST
       The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
     - PUT
       The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
     - DELETE
       The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
     - PATCH
       The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

   - HTTP status codes: https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html
   - HTTP header fields
     - Request headers
     - Response headers

3. Introduction to node.js
